Most of them have become a part of the Ukrainian business community through M&As, partner R&Ds, or outstaffing companies.  \n\n6. Boisterous tech community \n\nAgile Eastern Europe Conference, PyCon Ukraine, iForum, IT Arena, and DEV_Challenge are the greatest tech events among the variety all over the country. On such occasions, the chances to communicate with other professionals, share expertise, and follow the experiences of the most outstanding industry leaders are provided for Ukrainian IT representatives. The study published recently on developers.org.ua has shown that 60% of Ukrainian developers attend professional IT events on a regular basis.  \n\nThe 5 leading Ukrainian IT Communities are in Kyiv (25+ companies), Kharkiv (73 companies), Lviv, Dnipro (29 companies), and Odesa (18 companies).  \n\nThe greatest tech events draw over 7,000 visitors and international speakers from the world's leading companies like Skype, IBM, HP, SAP, Intel, and Dell, to name a few. In the regions and on a local level less significant conferences are organized, although their value should not be underestimated as they cover highly-discussed topics like AI, big data, virtual and augmented reality, data science, etc.  \n\n7. 80% of Ukrainian software developers know the English language \n\n80% of Ukraine’s tech professionals speak English on an intermediate or higher level (9). The greatest part of software development and IT outsourcing companies in Ukraine provide English tutorials for the teams to raise their English proficiency. \n\n8. Cultural adaptability and intractability \n\nWestern businesses' work ethics are rather identical to the ones prevailing in the Ukrainian IT outsourcing industry. Developers in Ukraine are not merely service providers. They are willing to face challenges and unpredictable situations, take personal responsibility for their projects and take great effort to succeed at the highest level. 60% of Ukrainian developers dedicate additional time to the improvement of their skills: study educational materials, attend classes or IT conferences. \n\nThis works in particular in the circumstances of direct communication, when no third-party is involved.",
